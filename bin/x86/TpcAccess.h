	\mainpage TpcAccess API Documentation
	
	\section intro_sec Introduction
	This documentation describes the application programming interface (API) for controling and 
	configuring a TransPC system and read out their measurement data.  A TransPC system has a server/client architecture where the 
	host holding the hardware (TPCX PCI cards) represents the server and the host on which runs the
	user application represents the client. The communication between the server and client is TCP/IP based, so it is
	possible to have the server and client software on different hosts which are connected over the 
	network. 
	
	This API is the interface to the user application and runs on the client side. All parameters and settings
	are managed on the server side. When different clients where connected to one server all clients get synchronized.     
	
	When a TransPC system consist on several servers they must be connected to a SyncLink for synchronization.

	\section api_sec The TpcAccess API
	The API is divided into modules, described here approximately 
	in the order as you might need them in a custom program. The term <i>device</i> has the same 
	meaning as the term <i>server</i> in the description above. 
	
	\ref Devices \n
	Setting up the system definition is done as the first step before 
	working with the system. The system definition is a list of devices that belong to
	the system and take part in the common measurement.  All devices should be connected to 
	the network and should also be interconnected via the SyncLink. Once the system definition is completed, TpcAccess
	will try to establish a connection to the devices and will query their properties and status, and will forward your
	commands to them. 
	
	\ref DeviceInfo \n
	Once the system definition is set up, TpcAccess will try to connect
	to each of the devices and get their information. With the functions in 
	this section you can query the properties of the hardware that was 
	found on the devices.
	
	\ref Configuration\n
	With the functions in this section you can set various recording 
	parameters for the next measurement, like the sample rate or input
	voltage range.
	
	\ref Cluster\n
	If there are several TPCX modules (boards) in the system it usefull to group them together (forming clusters)
	which simplifies the configuration. 
	
	
	\ref SystemCommands\n
	With the functions in this section you can send commands per system, e.g.
	start and stop measurements.
	
	\ref DeviceCommands\n
	With the functions in this section you can send commands per device, e.g.
	start calibration.
	
	\ref DeviceStatus\n
	Using the functions in this section you can query the status
	of the devices. This includes things like for example whether 
	a signal has already triggered, or the number of blocks that 
	the devices have recorded so far. Since the TransPC system is 
	capable of supporting multiple clients, observing clients can 
	detect changes caused by other clients that operate on the system.
	
	\ref DataReadout\n
	These are the functions that you need to read out the data 
	after a measurement has completed.
	
	\ref SettingFiles\n
	Functions to store the configuration to a file and load it again.
	
	
	
	\ref Misc\n
	Error codes, API Version, etc.

	/**
	 * \addtogroup Devices
	 * A TransPC system is a group of TransPC devices that perform a measurement togehter. 
	 * Each device has a unique URL that is used to connect to it over the network. 
	 * 
	 * TpcAccess stores a list of urls to devices that belong to the system. 
	 * It tries to connect to them or reestablish connection if lost.
	 *
	 * Prior to working with the system, the list of devices that make up the system
	 * (and that are linked together via the SyncLink) must be given to TpcAccess. 
	 * To do this, call the \ref TPC_BeginSystemDefinition function first, then add
	 * all devices that belong to the system via \ref TPC_AddDevice and call
	 * \ref TPC_EndSystemDefinition to finish the list. It may take a short 
	 * while until connection to the device is established.
	 *
	 * The order in which the URLs are added via \ref TPC_AddDevice is important, because
	 * for simpler access, devices are addressed via their index in this device list
	 * in all functions that refer to a device. The index starts with 0 for the first 
	 * device added via \ref TPC_AddDevice, 1 for the next one and so on.
	 *  
	 * Switching systems is possible by calling again \ref TPC_BeginSystemDefinition,
	 * \ref TPC_AddDevice and \ref TPC_EndSystemDefinition but this should not be used
	 * for working with several system in parallel. For this case use the commands \ref TPC_NewSystem, 
	 * \ref TPC_BeginSystemDefinitionSystem, \ref TPC_AddDeviceSystem and
	 * \ref TPC_EndSystemDefinitionSystem. The \ref TPC_NewSystem generates
	 * a new system which can be accessed over the system id. 
	 *
	 * \section Example
	 * Working with one system: <br>
	 *
	 * <TT>
	 * TPC_BeginSystemDefinition(); <br>
	 * int iDeviceId = TPC_AddDevice("192.168.0.100:10010"); <br>
	 * TPC_EndSystemDefinition(5000); <br>

	//=== Configuration ====================================================================

	/**
	* \addtogroup Configuration 
	*
	* There are several elements of configuration that can be set before the next recording
	* is started: Parameters, Attributes and associated channels (for ECR mode only).
	*
	* <i>Parameter</i> is just a collective name for settings in the form of double numbers that 
	* are assigned with a single input (channel parameters, e.g. input voltage range), or 
	* a cluster of the system (timebase parameters, e.g. sample rate).
	*
	* There are two kinds of parameters: Mode parameters and value parameters.
	* Mode parameters set a certain mode of operation, e.g. the trigger mode or the
	* filter mode. They use integer constants to specify the mode. Value parameters 
	* set a numerical value like the sample rate or the input range. The main difference
	* between mode and value parameters is in the error handling when trying to set
	* invalid values for the parameter. Mode parameters return an error if a invalid 
	* number is given. Value parameters just restrict the value to the closest possible 
	* one and no error is returned. 
	*
	* <i>Attributes</i> are key/value pairs (string/string) that can be assigned to each input.
	* They are ignored by the driver and free to use to store any kind of information.
	* Predefined attributes are (key/default value):
	* - "ChName"        "A1", "A2", .., "B1", ...
	* - "ChPhysUnit"    "V"
	*
	* <i>Associated channels</i> are used in ECR mode only. In ECR mode each channel
	* triggers and records data individually. Associated channels are a way to define
	* that other channels should also record data when a specified channel triggers.
	* See \ref TPC_GetAssociatedChannels and \ref TPC_SetAssociatedChannels.
	*
	\section Parameters
	
	There are two kinds of parameters: Mode parameters and value parameters.
	Mode parameters set a certain mode of operation, e.g. the trigger mode or the
	filter mode. They use integer constants to specify the mode. Value parameters 
	set a numerical value like the sample rate or the input range. The main difference
	between mode and value parameters is in the error handling when trying to set
	invalid values for the parameter. Mode parameters return an error if a invalid 
	number is given. Value parameters just restrict the value to the closest possible 
	one and no error is returned. 
	
	The most important parameters are these:
	\subsection paramsTB Time base parameters
	Timebase parameters cannot be set individually per channel. They are common per cluster. 
	- tpc_parOperationMode - sets the basic time base mode. See enum \ref TPC_OperationModes.
	- tpc_parSamplingFrequency - sets the sampling frequency in Hertz.
	\subsubsection paramsBlockMode Block Mode
	These parameters apply when tpc_parOperationMode is set to block mode.
	- tpc_parBlkNumberOfBlocks - The number of blocks to record. The recording will stop 
	automatically if this many blocks have been recorded.
	- tpc_parBlkBlockLength - The block length in samples.
	- tpc_parBlkTriggerDelay - Trigger delay in percent of the block length.
	\subsubsection paramsContinuousMode Continuous Mode
	These parameters apply when tpc_parOperationMode is set to continuous mode.
	- tpc_parContMaximumDataLength - Limits the maximum amount of data in samples to be 
	recorded. The recording will stop automatically if this many samples have been recorded. 
	\subsubsection paramsScopeMode Scope Mode
	These parameters apply when tpc_parOperationMode is set to scope mode.
	- tpc_parScopeAutoTrigger - Automatically fire a trigger after some time if the signal does not trigger.
	- tpc_parScopeSingleShot - Single shot mode, stops after each acquisition.
	\subsubsection paramsEventMode Event Recorder Mode
	These parameters apply when tpc_parOperationMode is set to event recorder mode.
	- tpc_parEcrMinimumBlockLength - The block length in samples.
	- tpc_parEcrTriggerDelay - Trigger delay in percent of the block length.
	- tpc_parEcrMaximumNumberOfBlocks - The number of blocks to record. The recording will stop 
	automatically if this many blocks have been recorded.
	
	\subsection inputTB Input parameters
	Input parameters can be set individually per channel.
	
	\subsubsection paramsInputRange Input Range
	These parameters define the input voltage range.	
	- tpc_parInputMode - Input mode: Off, Single ended, Differential. See enum \ref TPC_InputMode
	- tpc_parRange - Input voltage range in Volt. 
	- tpc_parOffset - Input range offset in percent. 
	
	The effective input range can be calculated as follows:\n
	min = -range * offset/100\n
	max = min + range\n
	Example: When setting tpc_parRange to 5 Volt and tpc_parOffset to 40%, the 
	effective input range will be -2 .. +3 Volt.
	
	\subsubsection paramsTrigger Trigger Parameters 
	These parameters define whether and how a channel triggers.
	- tpc_parTrgMode - Main trigger mode. See enum \ref TPC_TriggerModes.
	- tpc_parTrgComparatorMode - Trigger comparator mode:  Slope or window. See enum \ref TPC_TriggerComparatorMode.
	- tpc_parTrgLevelA - The first trigger level in percent of the full input range. 
	- tpc_parTrgLevelB - The second trigger level in percent of the full input range. 
	
	The effective trigger levels in Volt can be calculated as follows:\n
	level = tpc_parRange * tpc_parTrgLevelA / 100\n 
	Note: tpc_parOffset has no effect on the trigger level.\n
	Example: When setting the trigger and comparator mode to +Slope trigger, the
	first level will be the trigger level and the second level will be used as
	hysteresis. If tpc_parRange is set to 5Volt, tpc_parTrgLevelA is set to 10% 
	and tpc_parTrgLevelB to 9%, the channel will trigger if the signal falls 
	below 0.45 Volt (hysteresis) and then raises above 0.5 Volt.

	 * TpcAccess keeps a copy of the status of each device. This comprises:
	 *	- Parameters
	 *	- Attributes
	 *	- Recording state
	 *
	 * An application program has several methods to find out about changes in the status:
	 * - It can poll periodically. For each part of the status there is a counter 
	 *   that is incremented with each change, so the application can compare with the last 
	 *   counter values to detect changes and then react accordingly.
	 * - The application can install callbacks. (See \ref TPC_SetStatusCallback)
	 *   Please note: The callbacks are called from a different thread than the application 
	 *   main thread. The callbacks should return quickly. They are intended to send some kind 
	 *   of notification to your application, e.g. waking up another thread, setting a flag 
	 *   or posting a message into the message queue of a window. Do not do extensive data 
	 *   processing in this callback.

	//=== Data readout =====================================================================

	/**
	 * \addtogroup DataReadout
	 *
	The data consists of two parts:
	- The measured data samples, either as binary words or as floating point numbers.
	- Meta data which contains information about the interpretation of the data samples.
	
	The meta data can be useful in determining what part of the trace should be
	read out (e.g. desired time range -> actual sample index range), and how to 
	interpret the data (e.g. binary sample values -> values in Volt).
	
	The meta data is divided in two parts:
	- information about the amplitude (y meta data)
	- information about the time axis (t meta data)
	
	y meta data can be different for each input channel, but it stays the same for all 
	recorded blocks of that input during one acquisition series. t meta data can be 
	different for each recorded block and for each cluster, but it is the same for all 
	boards of the cluster. Exception: In single channel event recorder mode, each device
	that belongs to the cluster has a different set of t meta data records!
	
	The y meta data is available right after the start command has been given. However, some
	parts of the t meta data cannot be determined until the recording of a block has been
	completed. Depending on the recording mode these are: the absolute time of the trigger 
	(expressed as time since the start command), the block length and the channel reference 
	(in event recorder mode). It is possible to read the t meta data before the
	block is completed for block zero in Continuous and Dual mode. In Multi block
	mode or Event recorder mode, the t meta data should only be read after the
	corresponding block has been finished.
	
	TpcAccess allows two scaling modes for reading out data: raw data and scaled data.
	Raw data consists of the binary words as they are measured by the ADC, including the
	digital marker bits. Scaled data come as floating point numbers, scaled to Volt.
	
	You can also choose between reading out a data range or an envelope. When reading
	a data range you define which part of the measured block you want to read by 
	giving a start sample index and the length in samples and then you get all samples
	in that range. When reading an envelope you also specify which part of the block you 
	want to read by giving a start sample index and the length in samples, but you also
	give the number of envelope packets you want to get. The number of envelope packets is
	always smaller than the number of samples in the range you want to read. TpcAccess 
	then computes the envelope by dividing the specified data range into packets of 
	equal size and finds the minimum and maximum amplitude of each of them. This is 
	done very efficiently and allows to draw envelopes on the screen very quickly.
	
	Reading many small pieces of data with calls to TPC_GetXxxData can cause a lot of network 
	traffic. To increase throughput you can use a "compound get data operation" where
	a group of data requests and replies are exchanged with the devices in a single block.
	To do this use the TPC_DeferredGetXxxData functions instead of the TPC_GetXxxData calls. 
	These calls are not processed immediately but stored in an internal list. After all 
	requests are placed, the stored calls can be sent off to the devices collectively with 
	a call to TPC_ProcessDeferredDataRequests.
